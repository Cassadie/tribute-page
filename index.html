        <div id="tribute-info">Nicks joined Fleetwood Mac in <strong>1975</strong> along with her then-boyfriend Lindsey Buckingham.
            She began her solo career in <strong>1981</strong> and reached multiplatinum status with the album Bella Donna. Nicks was
            named one of the Top 100 Songwriters of All Time by Rolling Stone. She is the only woman to have been inducted
            twice into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as a member of Fleetwood Mac in <strong>1998</strong> and as a solo artist in <strong>2019</strong>. 
            She has garnered eight Grammy Award nominations and two American Music Award nominations as a solo artist.
            Her lyrics brought a poetic mystery to rock and roll at the time, and paved the way forward for female songwriters
            yet to come.
